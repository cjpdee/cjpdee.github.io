        "5.1 At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?\n\n—But it’s nicer here…. \n\nSo you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?\n\n—But we have to sleep sometime…. \n\nAgreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota.\n\nYou don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.\n\nIs helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?",
        "5.2 To shrug it all off and wipe it clean—every annoyance and distraction—and reach utter stillness.\n\nChild’s play.",
        "5.3 If an action or utterance is appropriate, then it’s appropriate for you. Don’t be put off by other people’s comments and criticism. If it’s right to say or do it, then it’s the right thing for you to do or say.\n\nThe others obey their own lead, follow their own impulses. Don’t be distracted. Keep walking. Follow your own nature, and follow Nature—along the road they share.",
        "5.4 I walk through what is natural, until the time comes to sink down and rest. To entrust my last breath to the source of my daily breathing, fall on the source of my father’s seed, of my mother’s blood, of my nurse’s milk. Of my daily food and drink through all these years. What sustains my footsteps, and the use I make of it—the many uses.",
        "5.5 No one could ever accuse you of being quick-witted.\n\nAll right, but there are plenty of other things you can’t claim you “haven’t got in you.” Practice the virtues you can show: honesty, gravity, endurance, austerity, resignation, abstinence, patience, sincerity, moderation, seriousness, high-mindedness. Don’t you see how much you have to offer—beyond excuses like “can’t”? And yet you still settle for less.\n\nOr is it some inborn condition that makes you whiny and grasping and obsequious, makes you complain about your body and curry favor and show off and leaves you so turbulent inside?\n\nNo. You could have broken free a long way back. And then you would have been only a little slow. “Not so quick on the uptake.”\n\nAnd you need to work on that as well—that slowness. Not something to be ignored, let alone to prize.",
        "5.6 Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren’t, but they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return.\n\nA horse at the end of the race …\n\nA dog when the hunt is over …\n\nA bee with its honey stored …\n\nAnd a human being after helping others.\n\nThey don’t make a fuss about it. They just go on to something else, as the vine looks forward to bearing fruit again in season.\n\nWe should be like that. Acting almost unconsciously.\n\n—Yes. Except conscious of it. Because it’s characteristic of social beings that they see themselves as acting socially. And expect their neighbors to see it too!\n\nThat’s true. But you’re misunderstanding me. You’ll wind up like the people I mentioned before, misled by plausible reasoning. But if you make an effort to understand what I’m saying, then you won’t need to worry about neglecting your social duty.",
        "5.7 Prayer of the Athenians:\n\nZeus, rain down, rain down\nOn the land and fields of Athens.\n\nEither no prayers at all—or one as straightforward as that.",
        "5.8 Just as you overhear people saying that “the doctor prescribed such-and-such for him” (like riding, or cold baths, or walking barefoot …), say this: “Nature prescribed illness for him.” Or blindness. Or the loss of a limb. Or whatever. There “prescribed” means something like “ordered, so as to further his recovery.” And so too here. What happens to each of us is ordered. It furthers our destiny.\n\nAnd when we describe things as “taking place,” we’re talking like builders, who say that blocks in a wall or a pyramid “take their place” in the structure, and fit together in a harmonious pattern.\n\nFor there is a single harmony. Just as the world forms a single body comprising all bodies, so fate forms a single purpose, comprising all purposes. Even complete illiterates acknowledge it when they say that something “brought on” this or that. Brought on, yes. Or prescribed it. And in that case, let’s accept it—as we accept what the doctor prescribes. It may not always be pleasant, but we embrace it—because we want to get well. Look at the accomplishment of nature’s plans in that light—the way you look at your own health—and accept what happens (even if it seems hard to accept). Accept it because of what it leads to: the good health of the world, and the well-being and prosperity of Zeus himself, who would not have brought this on anyone unless it brought benefit to the world as a whole. No nature would do that—bring something about that wasn’t beneficial to what it governed.\n\nSo there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it’s happening to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.\n\nThe other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world—of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its very existence, even. Because the whole is damaged if you cut away anything—anything at all—from its continuity and its coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that’s what you’re doing when you complain: hacking and destroying.",
        "5.9 Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.\n\nAnd not to think of philosophy as your instructor, but as the sponge and egg white that relieve ophthalmia—as a soothing ointment, a warm lotion. Not showing off your obedience to the logos, but resting in it. Remember: philosophy requires only what your nature already demands. What you’ve been after is something else again—something unnatural.\n\n—But what could be preferable?\n\nThat’s exactly how pleasure traps us, isn’t it? Wouldn’t magnanimity be preferable? Or freedom? Honesty? Prudence? Piety? And is there anything preferable to thought itself—to logic, to understanding? Think of their surefootedness. Their fluent stillness.",
        "5.10 Things are wrapped in such a veil of mystery that many good philosophers have found it impossible to make sense of them. Even the Stoics have trouble. Any assessment we make is subject to alteration—just as we are ourselves.\n\nLook closely at them—how impermanent they are, how meaningless. Things that a pervert can own, a whore, a thief.\n\nThen look at the way the people around you behave. Even the best of them are hard to put up with—not to mention putting up with yourself. In such deep darkness, such a sewer—in the flux of material, of time, of motion and things moved—I don’t know what there is to value or to work for.\n\nQuite the contrary. We need to comfort ourselves and wait for dissolution. And not get impatient in the meantime, but take refuge in these two things:\n\nNothing can happen to me that isn’t natural.\nI can keep from doing anything that God and my own spirit don’t approve. No one can force me to.",
        "5.11 What am I doing with my soul?\n\nInterrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child’s soul, an adolescent’s, a woman’s? A tyrant’s soul? The soul of someone who knows it’s nothing, and strives to become nothing? No. The soul of someone who holds himself together in his own chaos and acts with some sense of propriety, who learns to see everything from all sides and refuse to be affected by appearances alone. Such a soul remains steadfast. That is the soul you should try to develop now, and be constantly mindful of how you’re growing. Are you growing in wisdom, maturity, seriousness, patience? Look at yourself as if you were being observed by a wise and benevolent person.",
        "5.12 The pleasure of enjoying some luxurious food. And the unbearable burden of obtaining it, of preparing it. Or the pleasure of a pair of shoes, and the drudgery of acquiring and polishing them. Or of being able to command someone, and the responsibility, trouble, and irritation of maintaining that power, that privilege. The pleasure of going to a theater or a gymnasium, and the pettiness of getting there and back, the hassle of seeing others and being seen. And everything else: everything we seek in life is like this. With each pleasure comes a burden. The burden is the price we pay for the pleasure we seek. And the burdens are so many and so troublesome that they outweigh the pleasure. The price is often an inconvenience, often an insuperable burden. And if we don’t need to bear the burden, the pleasure is not worth it. It’s an evil, an actual, oppressive evil. So, what is the sensible and moral man to do? He ought to ask himself: what is the true value of these things? The real purpose of such pleasures? Then, what are the true burdens they bring with them? Which is more reasonable to bear? And if he decides that the burden is too great, let him reject the pleasure, and seek pleasure that is without burden.",
        "5.13 I am nature’s servant. I am part of nature’s economy, as a being born to be an agent. My mind and spirit have a natural place in the universe, just like everything else. And as a being born to fulfill my duty as a social being. Whatever happens, I must accept it as a necessity, and submit to it as a consequence of my being part of the whole. I am born to participate, to share in the whole, and to find my place in the system, no matter how small and insignificant. The true servant of nature accepts what happens, submits to the natural order, and finds joy in their role in the universe."
