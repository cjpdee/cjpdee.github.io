            "chapter": "1.3 My mother",
            "content": "Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she lived—not in the least like the rich."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.4 My great-grandfather",
            "content": "To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to accept the resulting costs as money well-spent."

        {
            "chapter": "1.5 My first teacher",
            "content": "Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers."

            "chapter": "1.6 Diognetus",
            "content": "Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and the cloak."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.7 Rusticus",
            "content": "The recognition that I needed to train and discipline my character. Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to write treatises on abstract questions, or deliver moralizing little sermons, or compose imaginary descriptions of The Simple Life or The Man Who Lives Only for Others. To steer clear of oratory, poetry and belles lettres. Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things like that. To write straightforward letters (like the one he sent my mother from Sinuessa). And to behave in a conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed us want to make up. To read attentively—not to be satisfied with 'just getting the gist of it.' And not to fall for every smooth talker. And for introducing me to Epictetus\u2019s lectures\u2014and loaning me his own copy."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.8 Apollonius",
            "content": "Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attention to nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos. And to be the same in all circumstances\u2014intense pain, the loss of a child, chronic illness. And to see clearly, from his example, that a man can show both strength and flexibility. His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who clearly viewed his expertise and ability as a teacher as the humblest of virtues. And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing your self-respect or appearing ungrateful."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.9 Sextus",
            "content": "Kindness. An example of fatherly authority in the home. What it means to live as nature requires. Gravity without airs. To show intuitive sympathy for friends, tolerance to amateurs and sloppy thinkers. His ability to get along with everyone: sharing his company was the highest of compliments, and the opportunity an honor for those around him. To investigate and analyze, with understanding and logic, the principles we ought to live by. Not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of passion and yet full of love. To praise without bombast; to display expertise without pretension."

            "content": "The literary critic Alexander: Not to be constantly correcting people, and in particular not to jump on them whenever they make an error of usage or a grammatical mistake or mispronounce something, but just answer their question or add another example, or debate the issue itself (not their phrasing), or make some other contribution to the discussion\u2014and insert the right expression, unobtrusively."

        {
            "chapter": "1.11 Fronto",

            "chapter": "1.12 Alexander the Platonist",
            "content": "Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I\u2019m too busy, unless I really am. Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people around me because of \u2018pressing business.\u2019"
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.13 Catulus",
            "content": "Not to shrug off a friend\u2019s resentment\u2014even unjustified resentment\u2014but try to put things right. To show your teachers ungrudging respect (the Domitius and Athenodotus story), and your children unfeigned love."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.14 My brother Severus",
            "content": "To love my family, truth and justice. It was through him that I encountered Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion and Brutus, and conceived of a society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all else. And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in valuing philosophy. And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and never to doubt your friends\u2019 affection for you. And that when people incurred his disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate about his attitude to anything: it was always clear."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.15",
            "content": "Maximus: Self-control and resistance to distractions. Optimism in adversity\u2014especially illness. A personality in balance: dignity and grace together. Doing your job without whining. Other people\u2019s certainty that what he said was what he thought, and what he did was done without malice. Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor hesitant\u2014or bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious\u2014but not aggressive or paranoid either. Generosity, charity, honesty. The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than being kept on it. That no one could ever have felt patronized by him\u2014or in a position to patronize him. A sense of humor."
        },
        {
            "chapter": "1.16",
            "content": "My adopted father: Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he\u2019d reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence. Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good. His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved. A sense of when to push and when to back off. Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys. His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind to take care of something always found him the same when he returned. His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost, never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely. His constancy to friends\u2014never getting fed up with them, or playing favorites. Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness. And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even minor things. His restrictions on acclamations\u2014and all attempts to flatter him. His constant devotion to the empire\u2019s needs. His stewardship of the treasury. His willingness to take responsibility\u2014and blame\u2014for both. His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Always sober, always steady, and never vulgar or a prey to fads. The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in such abundance\u2014without arrogance and without apology. If they were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn\u2019t miss them. No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him for what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified to govern both himself and them. His respect for people who practiced philosophy\u2014at least, those who were sincere about it. But without denigrating the others\u2014or listening to them. His ability to feel at ease with people\u2014and put them at their ease, without being pushy. His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac or obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment. This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts\u2014in oratory, law, psychology, whatever\u2014and to support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill his potential. That he respected tradition without needing to constantly congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values. Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but sticking with the same old places and the same old things. The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to what he was doing\u2014fresh and at the top of his game. That he had so few secrets\u2014only state secrets, in fact, and not all that many of those. The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds\u2014games, building projects, distributions of money and so on\u2014because he looked to what needed doing and not the credit to be gained from doing it. No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects, no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he accepted the customs agent\u2019s apology at Tusculum, etc.) He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose ends. You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark of a soul in readiness\u2014indomitable."

        {
            "chapter": "1.17 The gods",
            "content": "That I had good grandparents, a good mother and father, a good sister, good teachers, good servants, relatives, friends\u2014almost without exception. And that I never lost control of myself with any of them, although I had it in me to do that, and I might have, easily. But thanks to the gods, I was never put in that position, and so escaped the test. That I wasn\u2019t raised by my grandfather\u2019s girlfriend for longer than I was. That I didn\u2019t lose my virginity too early, and didn\u2019t enter adulthood until it was time\u2014put it off, even. That I had someone\u2014as a ruler and as a father\u2014who could keep me from being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live without a troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture\u2014the whole charade. That you can behave almost like an ordinary person without seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out official obligations. That I had the kind of brother I did. One whose character challenged me to improve my own. One whose love and affection enriched my life. That my children weren\u2019t born stupid or physically deformed. That I wasn\u2019t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I\u2019d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up. That I conferred on the people who brought me up the honors they seemed to want early on, instead of putting them off (since they were still young) with the hope that I\u2019d do it later. That I knew Apollonius, and Rusticus, and Maximus. That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as nature requires. The gods did all they could\u2014through their gifts, their help, their inspiration\u2014to ensure that I could live as nature demands. And if I\u2019ve failed, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but mine. Because I didn\u2019t pay attention to what they told me\u2014to what they taught me, practically, step by step. That my body has held out, especially considering the life I\u2019ve led. That I never laid a finger on Benedicta or on Theodotus. And that even later, when I was overcome by passion, I recovered from it. That even though I was often upset with Rusticus I never did anything I would have regretted later. That even though she died young, at least my mother spent her last years with me. That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself\u2014of having to take something from someone else. That I have the wife I do: obedient, loving, humble. That my children had competent teachers. Remedies granted through dreams\u2014when I was coughing blood, for instance, and having fits of dizziness. And the one at Caieta. That when I became interested in philosophy I didn\u2019t fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn\u2019t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics. All things for which \u2018we need the help of fortune and the gods.\u2019"
